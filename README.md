# HOW TO update stuff on our wonderful website

* Log into your github account and make sure the computer you are on has been listed through a ssh key
* Clone the repo:

`git clone git@github.com:ai4scmed/ai4scmed.github.io.git`


Now the fun can start!

NB: if you want to avoid to enter your SSH passphrase upon each action, you can used `ssh-add` once and for all on your computer.


So then the process is:
- make changes to the site
- push
- take a coffee!
- look at the webpage!


To be noted:
* Index page is layed out in `about.md`
* The rest are markdown pages. See [here for a cheat sheet.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
* Stored files are in the **files** folder
* Publications are automatically listed from the **_publications** folder via the publications.md file.
