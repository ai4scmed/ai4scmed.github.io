**[Sophie Abby](https://sophieabby.github.io/)** received a bi-disciplinary education in biology and
computer sciences. She is an evolutionary biologist, particularly
interested in the mechanisms of diversification of archaea and
bacteria. She studies these at different scales: from enzymes and metabolic pathways, to macromolecular
complexes and genome dynamics in response to environmental adaptations. She also develops
methods in the field of comparative genomics and phylogenomics, in particular for genome annotation.
