**Ivan Junier** is the resident biophycist expert. He works on rationalising the tinkering that has shaped the content, organisation and structuring of bacterial genomes. To this end, he develops quantitative, biophysical models of DNA in interaction with various fundamental proteins and molecular machineries that are crucial for gene expression, chromosome replication and chromosome segregation. To navigate in the (sometimes dark) space of bacterial genomes, he uses comparative genomics and statistical methods to distinguish between universal and idiosyncratic features.
