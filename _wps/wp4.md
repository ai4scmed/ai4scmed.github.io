- Development of dynamical computational and mathematical multiscale models
- Interacting scales, from molecules to tissue, the cell being at the center stage
- Modeling the multiscale dynamics of spatial interactions shaping heterogeneity of gonadotroph tumors
- Investigate multiscale mechanisms underlying ovarian follicle development and their changes all along reproductive lifespan
- In silico testing of novel treatments in a patient-centered manner
