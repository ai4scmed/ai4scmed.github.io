Secretion systems are complexes of proteins enabling a number of essential
functions for prokaryotic organisms (bacteria and archaea) such as acquiring nutrients or invading host cells. We are
interested in developping statistical learning and visualization methods and
software to better detect and explore the variability of secretion systems.


### Exploring the variability of secretion systems

We have downloaded a large set of prokaryotic genomes and annotated them with
the presence/absence of secretion systems. We are now interested in
exploring this mass of data to better extract biological knowledge.
Specifically, we are interested in:

- developping interactive visualization tools to explore the presence/absence 
  of different secretion system types in sets of organisms.
- developping interactive visualization tools to exlore the genomic context of
  proteins involved in each secretion systems, on the line of the following
  plot:

- perform some unsurpervised learning on physico-chemical properties of
  proteins involved in secretion systems to better characterize the
  variability of proteins.
